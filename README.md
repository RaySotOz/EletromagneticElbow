<h1>Electromagentic mechanism for commercial elbow prosthesis case</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I did the research and development of ferromagnetic physics and how to build a mechanism using it. Then using reverse engineering on a commercial elbow prosthesis, I developed the virtual model of this object. After using the discoveries of ferromagnetics, I designed a mechanism that fits inside the elbow prosthesis. Later, this was manufactured and several trials were done.
